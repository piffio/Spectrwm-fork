This is a simple fork of spectrwm, a minimalistic tiling window manager.

The original code is available here:

https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/spectrwm

This fork is mainly intended for my personal use, but you're free to check it out and use it
on your computer.

The original goals for this fork are 2:

- Get rid of the very annoing on mouse over focus mode (I couldn't find a way to get
  rid of this behaviour without modifying the code)

- Start playing with Git and GitHUB, since I'm a long time SVN user and I need a real project
  to get into a new SCM
